## AIM  
It's time to have a coooooooooool Aussie phone number! There are some mobile service provider allow customer to pick their own phone number. Let's make a crawler and fetch all the cool phone numbers avaible for purchase!

## Step 1: crawl all the availble phone number  
### Amaysim  
[Amaysim](https://www.amaysim.com.au/mobile/cart/unlimited-4gb?promo=EOFY23) allow customer to pick the phone number online. It will be very ez to fetch all the phone numbers from the [API](https://api.amaysim.com.au/mobile/graphql).  
I use Fiddler to repeatly call the API without worrying about the header/payload of the http request.
